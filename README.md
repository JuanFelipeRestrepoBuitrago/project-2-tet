# Project 2 - TET Bookstore

This repository contains the code for the **Bookstore Monolithic application**, which is a simple bookstore application that allows users to view, add, update, and delete books. The application is built using **Flask** and uses a **MySQL** database to store book information.

We must deploy this application in different ways to complete three objectives:

1. **Objective 1**: Deploy on a single AWS Virtual Machine with domain, SSL, and NGINX.
2. **Objective 2**: Deploy with autoscaling and load balancing on AWS.
3. **Objective 3**: Refactor and deploy using a microservices architecture on AWS.

## Objective 1: VM Deployment

Deploy the **Bookstore Monolithic application** on a **Virtual Machine on AWS**, with its own **domain**, **SSL certificate**, and **reverse proxy using NGINX**.

### Completion Features for Objective 1

- ‚úÖ **Completed**
- üåê **Domain**: [objective1.p2tet.duckdns.org](https://objective1.p2tet.duckdns.org) points to the Monolithic application.
- üîê **SSL Certificate**: Provided by Let's Encrypt and automatically renewed every 90 days.
- üîÅ **Reverse Proxy**: NGINX handles incoming requests and routes them to the application container.  
  - Domain: `p2tet.duckdns.org`
  - Subdomain for app: `objective1.p2tet.duckdns.org`
  - Reverse proxy terminates SSL and forwards requests to port 5000.
  - NGINX is hosted on a separate EC2 instance to support multiple objectives.

## Objective 2: Autoscaling Deployment

Cloud deployment of the monolithic application using **EC2 autoscaling**, **load balancing**, and a **highly available database**.

### Completion Features for Objective 2

- ‚úÖ **Completed**
- üîÑ **Extension of Objective 1**: Builds upon the previous setup, adding new infrastructure.
- üóÉÔ∏è **Highly Available Database**: Implemented using **Amazon Aurora and RDS**, allowing distributed access.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic among multiple app instances connected to a remote DB.
- :scroll: **NFS:** A Network File System is used among the members of the auto-scaling group to share static content.
- üìà **AWS Autoscaling**:
  - AMI-based scaling policy.
  - Minimum: 1 instance.
  - Maximum: 6 instances.
  - Desired capacity: 2 instances (scales based on demand).
- üåê **Domain**: [objective2.p2tet.duckdns.org](https://objective2.p2tet.duckdns.org) points to the Monolithic application with autoscaling.
